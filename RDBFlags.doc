                       Send me a gift if you like it.



This program lets you modify various flags in the RDB (Rigid Disk Block) of
your harddisk drives. It has no GUI and it doesn't restrict you in making
your harddisk a "totally useless piece of shit". So be careful!

It's absolutely harmless to call "RDBFlags" without any arguments or just
with an alternative device name or unit number: the program will only read
your RDB (if existing) and show its flags. Nothing will be modified.

Read this manual carefully! Most of this program's options change flags in
the RDB of your harddisk. Some options are dangerous because you can make
your drive inaccessable (at least with your current driver software). Then it
may help to set some jumpers on the harddisk to ignore the RDB settings, but
better don't count on that. Other options are less dangerous because they can
be set back easily if something won't work.

Your harddisk driver software may not support all flags you can set in the
RDB. So, don't despair if nothing special happens after a reboot ;-)

"RDBFlags" validates the RDB checksum as well as the sector size (also know
as block size) in various ways. If your RDB doesn't pass the validity checks
successfully, "RDBFlags" does nothing.

"RDBFlags" is pure (p-Flag set), thus it can be made resident. It requires
AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher).



Options? Ah... options! Call "RDBFlags ?" for a list of available options.
These are the harmless options. Nothing will be changed. "RDBFlags" will just
show you the current settings stored in the RDB.


	Device=<device>
	---------------

		Specify the driver software (device) for the harddisk.
		The default is "scsi.device", eg, for A2091 and A3000's
		internal controller.

		You're not limited to SCSI. IDE and other controllers
		will work as well if they support Commodore's RDB standard.


	Unit=<number>
	-------------

		Specify the unit number of the harddisk you want to access.
		The default is unit "0".


	SectorSize=<number>
	-------------------

		If your old driver software doesn't support the command
		TD_GETGEOMETRY to read the actual sector size (also known
		as block size) from the drive, this option let's you specify
		the sector size in bytes. The default is 512 bytes.

		In case that TD_GETGEOMETRY fails, RDBFlags outputs a
		warning message (with error condition) but continues to
		work. Use this option to set the sector size manually.

		This option is ignored if TD_GETGEOMETRY succeeds.



The following options may change your RDB but it should be possible to
restore the old settings (eg, with "RDBFlags" on a bootable floppy disk) if
something goes wrong.


	LastDisk or NoLastDisk
	--------    ----------

		Maybe the most useful option of this program. This flag
		signals the driver software to abort the scanning of further
		units and to boot now.

		Though this program is not limited to SCSI host adapters
		(it also works with IDE controllers if they support RDB)
		this is a typical SCSI scenario:

		When the Amiga boots, the driver checks all SCSI addresses
		(from 0 to 7) for drives. Some drivers will "hang" for
		a remarkable period of time when scanning drives that
		support removable media and no medium is currently present
		(eg, SyQuest and CD-ROM drives).

		For example, on the A3000's internal host adapter, the trick
		is quite simple (to avoid waiting):

		Assign the lower SCSI addresses to the drives that respond
		very quicky (eg, harddisks) and the higher numbers to the
		drives that may be very slow (eg, SyQuest, CD-ROM).  Then
		set the "LastDisk" flag on the last "quick" drive you have.
		This way all SCSI targets AFTER this drive (with a higher
		SCSI address) will not be mounted automatically at boot-time.
		You can add these drives later (when you need them) with
		"Mount" (eg, CD-ROM) or programs like "SCSIMounter" (eg,
		SyQuest) by Martin A. Blatter.

		BTW: From AmigaOS 3.1 on the internal host adapter of the
		A3000 doesn't really need "LastDisk" anymore because CBM's
		scsi.device will skip those "slow" drives very quickly.

		Some SCSI host adapters (or their driver software) don't
		scan SCSI addresses sequentially, so "LastDisk" will have
		a somewhat different meaning.  It's not guaranteed that
		all drives will be mounted which have a smaller address
		than the drive with "LastDisk" set in its RDB.

		Recapitulating, the "LastDisk" flag just means:

		When scanning (and trying to automount) drives at boot-time,
		then stop scanning and boot immediately if the "LastDisk"
		flag is found in a disk's RDB.  In general, no assumptions
		can be made about the state of the other drives (but this
		depends on your driver software).

		So you might want to experiment a little bit with this
		flag to fit your needs.  Some driver software treats
		"LastDisk" and "LastTarget" as equal (although they are
		not), so think about it when experimenting ;-)


	LastTarget or NoLastTarget
	----------    ------------

		If the "LastTarget" flag is set on a drive, no further
		SCSI targets will be scanned. The meaning of this flag
		is not absolutely clear; at first sight it looks similar
		to the "LastDisk" flag, but it isn't.

		Some people say this flag is for buggy drives that
		respond to all SCSI addresses. It's obvious that you
		can only use exactly one such drive on the SCSI bus.

		Maybe it's a good idea to don't use it at all ;-)



Other useful utilities (not only in case of problems or failure) are
"SetBatt" (modify battery memory in A3000, by Andreas M. Kirchwitz) and
"SCSIMounter" (mount/update devices after boot-time, by Martin A. Blatter).

Okay, and now for some more options ...

The following options may change your RDB and are VERY DANGEROUS because they
could make your harddisk unusable. Use only if you know for sure that your
harddisk supports it.


	LastLun or NoLastLun
	-------    ---------

		Each SCSI target (0-7, except for the host adapter) is
		subdivided into logical unit numbers (LUN 0-7).

		If the "LastLun" flag is found on a disk, the driver
		software will not search for LUNs (logical unit numbers)
		greater then the current one (on this SCSI target).

		For drives with only one logical unit the "LastLun" flag is
		typically set in the RDB of the disk with LUN 0.

		This flag is similar to "LastDisk", except that "LastLun"
		marks the last LUN on one SCSI target (and not the last
		SCSI target on the SCSI bus).


	Reselect or NoReselect
	--------    ----------

		Reselection is useful for slow drives or actions that will
		take a long time to execute (eg, CD-ROMs). It allows the
		drive to disconnect from the bus, do its job and finally
		reconnect to the bus when its done. In the meantime the bus
		is free for other tasks.

		If your driver software or your drive doesn't support
		Reselection (disconnect/reconnect) correctly, then set
		the "NoReselect" flag so that the driver software doesn't
		ask for Reselection when talking to this drive.


	Sync or NoSync
	----    ------

		Maybe the most dangerous option of this program. With this
		flag you can set for each drive individually if it supports
		synchronous transfer or not. If "NoSync" is set, the "slow"
		(but by all drives supported) asynchronous transfer is used.

		"So why is it dangerous", you may ask.  Now, some drives
		that don't support sync transfer will not just say, "hey,
		I don't support sync, let's talk async." They'll just hang.
		Totally inaccessable until next reboot. But with the "Sync"
		flag set in the RDB the driver software will ALWAYS ask for
		sync at boot-time, so the drive will always hang. You will
		NEVER reach a state to clear the "Sync" flag in the RDB,
		if you don't have a host adapter that allows you to ignore
		the RDB settings temporarily.

		Set "Sync" only if you KNOW FOR SURE that the drive supports
		synchronous transfer. Elsewhere, you may lose the contents
		of your drive.

		This is not supported by all drives and driver software,
		so you may not notice any difference.  Some host adapters
		only allow to toggle synchronous/asynchronous transfer
		globally for all drives (eg, A3000 with its internal
		battery memory).



History
-------

1.2	initial release
1.3	option "SectorSize" overrides dg_SectorSize from TD_GETGEOMETRY
	(even if TD_GETGEOMETRY returns no error) because some drivers
	don't set dg_SectorSize correctly
